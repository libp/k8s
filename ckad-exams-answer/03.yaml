# Given an existing kubernetes cluster running version 1.20.5, upgrade all of the kubernetes control plain and node components on the master node only to version 1.21.0.
# you are also expected to upgrade kubelet and kubectl on the master node 

# tips: Be sure to drain the master node before upgrading it and uncordon it after the upgrade.
# Do not upgrade the worker nodes,etcd,the container manager,the CNI plugin, the DNS service or any other addons.
